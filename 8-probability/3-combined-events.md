# Combined Events (Foundation Level)

## Explanation
Combined events involve two or more happenings. Sample space diagrams list all possible outcomes, frequency trees show repeated trials, and tree diagrams calculate probabilities by multiplying along branches.

3. From the two dice diagram, what's the probability of getting a total of 8?
4. Draw a sample space diagram for flipping two coins
5. From the two coins diagram, what's the probability of getting one head and one tail?
