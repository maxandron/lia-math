# Combined Events (Foundation Level)

## Explanation
Combined events involve two or more happenings. Sample space diagrams list all possible outcomes, frequency trees show repeated trials, and tree diagrams calculate probabilities by multiplying along branches.

## Exercises

### Sample Space Diagrams
*Image needed: Sample space diagrams showing all possible outcomes*
1. Draw a sample space diagram for rolling two dice. How many outcomes are there?
2. From the two dice diagram, list all ways to get a total of 7
3. From the two dice diagram, what's the probability of getting a total of 8?
4. Draw a sample space diagram for flipping two coins
5. From the two coins diagram, what's the probability of getting one head and one tail?
6. Draw a sample space diagram for spinning two spinners (each with Red, Blue, Green)
7. From the spinners diagram, what's the probability of getting two different colors?
8. List all outcomes when picking a card (A, 2, 3) and flipping a coin
9. What's the probability of getting (A, Heads) from question 8?
10. How many total outcomes are there when rolling a dice and flipping a coin?

### Simple Frequency Trees
*Image needed: Frequency trees showing trial outcomes*
1. A coin is flipped twice. Draw a frequency tree if the first flip shows 6 heads, 4 tails
2. From question 1, how many times did HH occur?
3. A bag contains red and blue balls. In 20 picks: 12 red, 8 blue. If each red ball is returned and picked again, draw the frequency tree
4. From question 3, how many times was blue picked twice?
5. A dice shows even numbers 15 times, odd numbers 10 times in 25 rolls. Draw frequency tree for two rolls
6. From question 5, how many times did two even numbers occur?
7. A spinner shows A:8 times, B:12 times in 20 spins. Draw frequency tree for spinning twice
8. From question 7, what fraction of outcomes resulted in AB or BA?
9. In a survey, 30 people: 18 like tea, 12 like coffee. If asked twice, draw the frequency tree
10. From question 9, how many people said tea both times?

### Tree Diagrams for Two Events
*Image needed: Tree diagrams with probabilities on branches*
1. Draw a tree diagram for flipping a coin twice. Find P(two heads)
2. Draw a tree diagram for rolling a dice twice. Find P(two 6s)
3. A bag has 3 red, 2 blue balls. Draw tree diagram for picking two balls with replacement. Find P(red, blue)
4. A spinner has P(red) = 0.4, P(blue) = 0.6. Draw tree diagram for two spins. Find P(same color both times)
5. Two coins are biased: P(heads) = 0.7 each. Find P(exactly one head)
6. A test has P(pass) = 0.8. Find P(passing both tests) if taken twice
7. Weather: P(rain) = 0.3 each day. Find P(rain on exactly one of two days)
8. A machine: P(working) = 0.9. Find P(both machines working) for two identical machines
9. Drawing cards with replacement: P(heart) = 0.25. Find P(at least one heart in two draws)
10. Two dice: Find P(at least one 6) when rolling both

### Mixed Combined Events Problems
*Image needed: Various scenarios requiring combined probability calculations*
1. Roll a dice and flip a coin. What's P(even number AND heads)?
2. Pick two cards with replacement. What's P(both aces)?
3. Two students each guess an answer: P(correct) = 0.6 each. What's P(both wrong)?
4. Spin two identical spinners with 4 equal sections (1,2,3,4). What's P(total = 5)?
5. Two traffic lights: P(green) = 0.4 each. What's P(at least one green)?
6. Pick a ball from bag A (2 red, 3 blue) and bag B (1 red, 4 blue). What's P(both red)?
7. Roll two dice. What's P(first die shows 6 OR second die shows 6)?
8. Two friends take a test: P(pass) = 0.7 and 0.8. What's P(exactly one passes)?
9. Flip three coins. What's P(exactly two heads)?
10. Pick two people randomly. P(wearing glasses) = 0.25 each. What's P(neither wears glasses)?
