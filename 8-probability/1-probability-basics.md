# Probability Basics

## Explanation
Probability measures how likely events are to happen, using a scale from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). Common words describe likelihood: impossible, unlikely, even chance, likely, certain.

## Exercises

### Probability Scale (0-1)
*Image needed: Probability scale from 0 to 1 with key points marked*
1. Where on the probability scale would you place "definitely will happen"?
2. Where on the probability scale would you place "never will happen"?
3. Where on the probability scale would you place "might happen"?
4. What probability value represents "even chance"?
5. Is a probability of 1.5 possible? Explain why or why not
6. Is a probability of -0.2 possible? Explain why or why not
7. Place these events on the probability scale: certain, impossible, unlikely, likely
8. What does a probability of 0.8 tell you about an event?
9. What does a probability of 0.1 tell you about an event?
10. Order these probabilities from least to most likely: 0.7, 0.2, 0.9, 0.4
