## Learning Objectives

- Solve simultaneous equations using the elimination method
- Apply simultaneous equations to real-world problems

## Key Concepts

### What are Simultaneous Equations?
Simultaneous equations are two or more equations that must be solved together to find values that satisfy all equations at the same time.

**Example:**
```
x + y = 7    (equation 1)
2x - y = 5   (equation 2)
```

We need to find values of x and y that make both equations true.

## Method 1: Substitution

**Steps:**
1. Solve one equation for one variable
2. Substitute this expression into the other equation
3. Solve for the remaining variable
4. Substitute back to find the other variable
5. Check your answer

**Example:**
```
x + y = 7    ... (1)
2x - y = 5   ... (2)
```

**Step 1:** From equation (1): y = 7 - x

**Step 2:** Substitute into equation (2):
2x - (7 - x) = 5
2x - 7 + x = 5
3x - 7 = 5
3x = 12
x = 4

**Step 3:** Substitute back: y = 7 - 4 = 3

**Step 4:** Check: 4 + 3 = 7 ✓ and 2(4) - 3 = 5 ✓

**Solution:** x = 4, y = 3

## Method 2: Elimination

**Steps:**
1. Make the coefficients of one variable the same (or opposite)
2. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate that variable
3. Solve for the remaining variable
4. Substitute back to find the other variable
5. Check your answer

**Example:**
```
3x + 2y = 16   ... (1)
x - 2y = 4     ... (2)
```

**Step 1:** The y coefficients are already opposite (+2y and -2y)

**Step 2:** Add equations (1) + (2):
(3x + 2y) + (x - 2y) = 16 + 4
4x = 20
x = 5

**Step 3:** Substitute into equation (2):
5 - 2y = 4
-2y = -1
y = 0.5

**Step 4:** Check: 3(5) + 2(0.5) = 16 ✓ and 5 - 2(0.5) = 4 ✓

**Solution:** x = 5, y = 0.5

## When Coefficients Need Adjusting

**Example:**
```
2x + 3y = 7    ... (1)
3x + y = 5     ... (2)
```

To eliminate y, multiply equation (2) by 3:
```
2x + 3y = 7     ... (1)
9x + 3y = 15    ... (2) × 3
```

Subtract (1) from (2):
7x = 8
x = 8/7

## Real-world Applications

### Example 1: Age Problem
Tom is 3 years older than Sarah. The sum of their ages is 27. How old are they?

Let T = Tom's age, S = Sarah's age
```
T = S + 3       ... (1)
T + S = 27      ... (2)
```

Substitute (1) into (2):
(S + 3) + S = 27
2S + 3 = 27
2S = 24
S = 12

Therefore: Sarah is 12, Tom is 15

### Example 2: Money Problem
5 apples and 3 bananas cost £2.20. 2 apples and 4 bananas cost £1.60. Find the cost of each fruit.

Let a = cost of apple, b = cost of banana
```
5a + 3b = 2.20  ... (1)
2a + 4b = 1.60  ... (2)
```

Multiply (1) by 4 and (2) by 3:
```
20a + 12b = 8.80  ... (1) × 4
6a + 12b = 4.80   ... (2) × 3
```

Subtract:
14a = 4.00
a = £0.286 ≈ £0.29

Substitute back: b = £0.155 ≈ £0.16

## Types of Solutions

### One Solution
Most simultaneous equations have exactly one solution (the lines intersect at one point).

### No Solution
If the equations represent parallel lines, there's no solution.
Example: x + y = 5 and x + y = 3

### Infinite Solutions
If the equations represent the same line, there are infinite solutions.
Example: x + y = 5 and 2x + 2y = 10

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sign errors** when rearranging equations
2. **Forgetting to check** your answer in both original equations
3. **Arithmetic mistakes** when multiplying equations
4. **Not clearly labeling** which equation is which

## Practice Tips

1. Always check your answer by substituting back into both original equations
2. Choose the elimination method when coefficients are already similar
3. Choose substitution when one equation can be easily rearranged
4. Keep your working neat and organized
5. Practice with different types of real-world problems
