# Prime Factors, HCF & LCM

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Find the prime factorisation of numbers
- Calculate the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two or more numbers
- Calculate the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers
- Use HCF and LCM to solve real-world problems

## Key Concepts

### Prime Numbers
A prime number has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.
- Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23...
- 1 is NOT a prime number

### Prime Factorisation
Breaking down a number into its prime factors.

**Example:** 60 = 2² × 3 × 5

**Method:** Use a factor tree
```
    60
   /  \
  4   15
 / \  / \
2   2 3  5
```

### Highest Common Factor (HCF)
The largest number that divides into two or more numbers exactly.

**Method 1: List factors**
- Find HCF of 18 and 24
- Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
- Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
- Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6
- HCF = 6

**Method 2: Prime factorisation**
- 18 = 2 × 3²
- 24 = 2³ × 3
- HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6 (lowest powers of common prime factors)

### Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)
The smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.

**Method 1: List multiples**
- Find LCM of 6 and 8
- Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...
- Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32...
- LCM = 24

**Method 2: Prime factorisation**
- 6 = 2 × 3
- 8 = 2³
- LCM = 2³ × 3 = 24 (highest powers of all prime factors)

**Formula:** LCM × HCF = Product of the two numbers

## Applications

### Simplifying Fractions
Use HCF to simplify fractions:
- 18/24 = (18÷6)/(24÷6) = 3/4

### Adding Fractions
Use LCM to find common denominators:
- 1/6 + 1/8 = 4/24 + 3/24 = 7/24

### Real-world Problems
- **Scheduling:** Two events repeat every 6 and 8 days. When do they coincide? (LCM = 24 days)
- **Sharing:** Divide 18 apples and 24 oranges into equal groups. Maximum group size? (HCF = 6)

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Prime Factorisation
Find the prime factorisation of 84.
```
84 = 4 × 21 = 4 × 3 × 7 = 2² × 3 × 7
```

### Example 2: HCF and LCM
Find HCF and LCM of 45 and 60.
- 45 = 3² × 5
- 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
- HCF = 3 × 5 = 15
- LCM = 2² × 3² × 5 = 180

### Example 3: Problem Solving
Two gears have 18 and 24 teeth. After how many rotations of each gear will they return to the same position?
- Need LCM of 18 and 24 = 72
- First gear: 72 ÷ 18 = 4 rotations
- Second gear: 72 ÷ 24 = 3 rotations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Confusing HCF and LCM
2. Including 1 as a prime number
3. Not using lowest powers for HCF or highest powers for LCM
4. Forgetting to check if numbers share common factors
