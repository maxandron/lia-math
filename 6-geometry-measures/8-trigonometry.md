# Trigonometry (Higher Level)

## Explanation
Trigonometry uses ratios (sin, cos, tan) to find missing sides and angles in right-angled triangles.

## Exercises

### Basic Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan)
1. Find sin 30°
2. Find cos 45°
3. Find tan 60°
4. In a right triangle, opposite = 5, hypotenuse = 13, find sin θ
5. In a right triangle, adjacent = 8, hypotenuse = 10, find cos θ
6. In a right triangle, opposite = 12, adjacent = 5, find tan θ
7. Find the angle θ where sin θ = 0.5
8. Find the angle θ where cos θ = 0.707
9. Find the angle θ where tan θ = 1
10. In a right triangle, find the hypotenuse if opposite = 7, adjacent = 24
