# Bearings

## Explanation
Bearings are directions measured clockwise from north, always written as 3-figure numbers (e.g., 045°, 270°). Compass directions relate to bearings: N=000°, E=090°, S=180°, W=270°.

## Exercises

### Simple 3-Figure Bearings
*Image needed: Compass diagrams showing various directions*
1. Write the bearing for due East
2. Write the bearing for due South
3. Write the bearing for due West
4. Write the bearing for North-East (halfway between N and E)
5. Write the bearing for South-East (halfway between S and E)
6. Write the bearing for South-West (halfway between S and W)
7. Write the bearing for North-West (halfway between N and W)
8. Convert 30° clockwise from North to a 3-figure bearing
9. Convert 60° clockwise from North to a 3-figure bearing
10. Convert 120° clockwise from North to a 3-figure bearing

### Reading Bearings from Diagrams
*Image needed: Various diagrams showing positions with North arrows*
1. Point A is directly east of point B. What is the bearing of A from B?
2. Point C is directly south of point D. What is the bearing of C from D?
3. Point E is 45° clockwise from north of point F. What is the bearing of E from F?
4. Point G is 30° anticlockwise from east of point H. What is the bearing of G from H?
5. Point I is directly west of point J. What is the bearing of I from J?
6. Point K is 60° clockwise from north of point L. What is the bearing of K from L?
7. Point M is directly north of point N. What is the bearing of M from N?
8. Point O is 45° clockwise from south of point P. What is the bearing of O from P?
9. Point Q is 30° clockwise from west of point R. What is the bearing of Q from R?
10. Point S is 15° anticlockwise from north of point T. What is the bearing of S from T?
