# Data Collection & Organisation

## Explanation
Data collection involves gathering information systematically. Tally charts use marks to count, frequency tables show how often values occur, and two-way tables compare two variables.

## Exercises

### Collecting and Organising Data
*Image needed: Sample data collection scenarios*
1. List 5 ways you could collect data about students' favorite subjects
2. What type of data is "height in centimeters"? (categorical or numerical)
3. What type of data is "favorite color"? (categorical or numerical)
4. Give 3 examples of categorical data
5. Give 3 examples of numerical data
6. Why might you use a sample instead of surveying everyone?
7. What's the difference between primary and secondary data?
8. List 3 sources of secondary data
9. What makes a good survey question?
10. Why should survey questions avoid bias?

### Tally Charts
*Image needed: Examples of tally marks and completed tally charts*
1. Draw tally marks for: 7 people
2. Draw tally marks for: 12 items
3. Draw tally marks for: 23 responses
4. What number do these tally marks represent: ||||  ||||  |||
5. What number do these tally marks represent: ||||  ||||  ||||  ||
6. Complete a tally chart for this data (favorite pets): dog, cat, dog, fish, dog, cat, bird, dog, cat, fish
7. Complete a tally chart for this data (dice rolls): 3, 1, 4, 1, 6, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2
8. From your pet tally chart, which pet is most popular?
9. From your dice tally chart, which number appeared most often?
10. How many pets were surveyed in total in question 6?

### Frequency Tables
*Image needed: Sample frequency tables*
1. Create a frequency table for this data (test scores): 85, 90, 85, 75, 80, 85, 90, 75, 80, 85
2. Create a frequency table for this data (shoe sizes): 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 8, 7, 6, 5, 7, 6, 8
3. From the test scores frequency table, which score appeared most frequently?
4. From the shoe sizes frequency table, what's the total number of people surveyed?
5. Create a grouped frequency table for ages: 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 16, 19, 24, 30 (use groups: 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34)
6. From the grouped age table, which age group has the most people?
7. Create a frequency table for this data (colors): red, blue, red, green, blue, red, yellow, blue, green, red
8. What's the least frequent color in question 7?
9. How many people chose blue in the color survey?
10. What's the total frequency in the color table?

### Two-Way Tables

1. Complete this two-way table: 20 boys like football, 15 boys like tennis, 25 girls like football, 30 girls like tennis
2. From the sports table, how many students like football in total?
3. From the sports table, how many girls were surveyed?
4. Complete this two-way table: 12 adults drink tea, 8 adults drink coffee, 18 children drink juice, 5 children drink milk
5. From the drinks table, how many people were surveyed in total?
6. What's the most popular drink among adults?

8. From the transport table, which year group has more students?
9. What's the most common way to get to school overall?
10. How many more Year 8 students take the bus compared to Year 7?
