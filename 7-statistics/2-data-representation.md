# Data Representation

## Explanation
Data can be displayed using various charts and graphs. Bar charts show categorical data, pictograms use symbols, pie charts show parts of a whole, line graphs show trends over time, and histograms display grouped numerical data.

## Exercises

### Bar Charts
*Image needed: Sample bar charts with different scales and orientations*
1. Draw a bar chart for this data (favorite subjects): Math-15, English-12, Science-18, History-8, Art-10
2. From the subjects bar chart, which subject is most popular?
3. How many more students chose Science than History?
4. What's the total number of students surveyed?
5. Draw a bar chart for this data (pets owned): Dogs-25, Cats-20, Fish-8, Birds-5, Rabbits-12
6. Which pet is least common?
7. How many pets are there in total?
8. What's the difference between the most and least popular pets?
9. If the scale goes up in 5s, what would be the height of the Dogs bar?
10. Name one advantage of using a bar chart to display this data

### Pictograms
*Image needed: Sample pictograms with different symbols and keys*
1. Draw a pictogram for cars sold: Monday-20, Tuesday-30, Wednesday-15, Thursday-25, Friday-35 (use ðŸš— = 5 cars)
2. From the car sales pictogram, which day had the highest sales?
3. How many symbols would represent Wednesday's sales?
4. What's the total number of cars sold in the week?
5. Draw a pictogram for books read: Amy-12, Ben-8, Carol-16, Dan-4, Eve-20 (use ðŸ“š = 4 books)
6. Who read the most books?
7. How many symbols represent Carol's reading?
8. What's the total number of books read by everyone?
9. How many more books did Eve read than Dan?
10. Why might you choose a pictogram instead of a bar chart?

### Pie Charts
*Image needed: Sample pie charts with labeled sectors and angles*
1. In a pie chart of 60 students' favorite colors: Red-20, Blue-15, Green-10, Yellow-15. What angle represents Red?
2. What angle represents Blue in the colors pie chart?
3. What fraction of students chose Green?
4. Draw a pie chart for transport to school: Walk-90Â°, Bus-120Â°, Car-100Â°, Bike-50Â°
5. Which transport method is most popular?
6. What fraction of students walk to school?
7. How many students were surveyed if the total is 360Â°?
8. If 180 students were surveyed, how many walk to school?
9. What angle would represent 25% of the pie chart?
10. Name one disadvantage of pie charts compared to bar charts

### Line Graphs and Simple Histograms
*Image needed: Sample line graphs showing trends and simple histograms*
1. Draw a line graph for temperature over a week: Mon-15Â°C, Tue-18Â°C, Wed-22Â°C, Thu-20Â°C, Fri-25Â°C, Sat-28Â°C, Sun-24Â°C
2. On which day was the temperature highest?
3. What was the temperature difference between the hottest and coldest days?
4. Between which two consecutive days did the temperature rise most?
5. Draw a simple histogram for test scores: 0-20 (2 students), 21-40 (5 students), 41-60 (12 students), 61-80 (15 students), 81-100 (8 students)
6. Which score range had the most students?
7. How many students scored above 60?
8. What's the total number of students who took the test?
9. What percentage of students scored between 41-60?
10. Why use a histogram instead of a bar chart for this data?
