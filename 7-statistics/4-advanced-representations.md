# Advanced Representations

## Explanation
Advanced charts show relationships and distributions. Scatter diagrams show correlation between variables, cumulative frequency shows running totals, and box plots display quartiles and spread.

## Exercises

### Scatter Diagrams (Basic Correlation)
*Image needed: Sample scatter diagrams showing positive, negative, and no correlation*
1. Describe the correlation between height and shoe size (positive, negative, or none)
2. Describe the correlation between temperature and ice cream sales
3. Describe the correlation between hours of TV watched and exam scores
4. Describe the correlation between age of car and its value
5. Plot these points and describe correlation: (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,8), (5,10)
6. Plot these points and describe correlation: (1,10), (2,8), (3,6), (4,4), (5,2)
7. What type of correlation would you expect between hours studied and test scores?
8. What type of correlation would you expect between price of items and number sold?
9. Give an example of two variables with no correlation
10. Give an example of two variables with strong positive correlation

### Cumulative Frequency (Basic Interpretation)
*Image needed: Sample cumulative frequency tables and curves*

2. From the heights table, how many people are 160cm or shorter?
3. From the heights table, what's the total number of people surveyed?
4. Complete cumulative frequency for test scores: 0-20 (3), 21-40 (8), 41-60 (15), 61-80 (20), 81-100 (4)
5. How many students scored 60 or below?
6. How many students scored above 60?
7. What percentage of students scored 40 or below?
8. In a cumulative frequency curve, what does the highest point represent?
9. Complete cumulative frequency for ages: 10-20 (6), 21-30 (14), 31-40 (25), 41-50 (18), 51-60 (7)
10. What fraction of people are aged 40 or younger?

### Box Plots
*Image needed: Sample box plots showing quartiles, median, and outliers*
1. For this data set: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. Find the median
2. Find the lower quartile (Q1) for the data in question 1
3. Find the upper quartile (Q3) for the data in question 1
4. What's the interquartile range (IQR) for the data in question 1?
5. Draw a box plot for: 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 32, 35
6. From a box plot, which line in the middle represents the median?
7. What percentage of data lies between Q1 and Q3?
8. If a box plot shows Q1=10, Median=15, Q3=20, what's the IQR?
9. Compare two box plots: A has IQR=8, B has IQR=12. Which shows more spread?
10. What advantage do box plots have over histograms?

### Interpreting Advanced Charts
*Image needed: Various complex statistical charts for interpretation*
1. A scatter diagram shows strong positive correlation. What can you conclude?
2. A cumulative frequency curve is steepest between 60-70. What does this mean?
3. A box plot has a very short box but long whiskers. What does this suggest about the data?
4. Two scatter plots: A shows r=0.9, B shows r=0.3. Which has stronger correlation?
5. In a cumulative frequency table, the final total is 150. How many people were in the survey?
6. A box plot shows median=50, Q1=40, Q3=60. What's the range of the middle 50% of data?
7. A scatter diagram shows no correlation. Should you draw a line of best fit?
8. What does it mean if a cumulative frequency curve is nearly flat in one section?
9. If two box plots have the same median but different IQRs, what's different about the data sets?
10. Give one limitation of using scatter diagrams to show relationships
