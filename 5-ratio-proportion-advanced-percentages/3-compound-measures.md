# Compound Measures

## Explanation
Compound measures combine two or more basic units. Speed = distance ÷ time, density = mass ÷ volume, and pressure = force ÷ area are key examples.

## Exercises

### Speed = Distance ÷ Time
1. A car travels 120 miles in 3 hours. What is its average speed?
2. A cyclist covers 45 km in 1.5 hours. What is their speed?
3. A train travels 240 km in 4 hours. What is its speed?
4. A runner completes 10 km in 50 minutes. What is their speed in km/h?
5. A plane flies 600 miles in 2 hours. What is its speed?
6. A walker covers 12 km in 3 hours. What is their speed?
7. A bus travels 150 miles in 5 hours. What is its average speed?
8. A boat sails 80 km in 2 hours. What is its speed?
9. A jogger runs 8 km in 40 minutes. What is their speed in km/h?
10. A motorbike travels 180 miles in 3 hours. What is its speed?

### Distance and Time Calculations
1. A car travels at 60 mph for 2.5 hours. How far does it go?
2. How long does it take to travel 150 km at 50 km/h?
3. A cyclist travels at 20 km/h for 3 hours. What distance is covered?
4. How long does it take to walk 15 km at 5 km/h?
5. A train travels at 80 mph for 1.5 hours. How far does it go?
6. How long does it take to drive 240 miles at 60 mph?
7. A runner maintains 12 km/h for 45 minutes. What distance is covered?
8. How long does it take to fly 900 miles at 300 mph?
9. A boat travels at 25 km/h for 2.4 hours. What distance is covered?
10. How long does it take to cycle 36 km at 18 km/h?
